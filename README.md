# Project Euler Solutions

This is where I'll be uploading my solutions to project euler problems. Within each folder are solutions in the programming languages I know(currently Python and Racket). My goal is to use only the standard implementation of each language - hence I will not be using external packages if at all possible. I also intend to make each solution as elegant and generalizable as possible.
